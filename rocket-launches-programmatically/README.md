Initialization:

When the app starts, the SceneDelegate initializes the RocketsViewController using the RocketsConfigurator.
The RocketsConfigurator sets up all VIPER components for RocketsViewController and connects them together.

View Loading:

RocketsViewController's viewDidLoad method gets called. Within this method, it informs the presenter that the view has loaded by calling presenter.viewDidLoad().
The Presenter asks the Interactor to fetch the rocket data by invoking interactor?.fetchRockets().

Fetching Data:

The Interactor will fetch the rocket data (this can be from a local database, an API, etc., depending on the actual implementation). Once done, the Interactor sends the data back to the Presenter.
If the fetch is successful, the Interactor invokes didRetrieveRockets(_:) on the Presenter and passes the rocket data.
If there's an error, it would call didFailToRetrieveRockets(withError:) on the Presenter.

Presenting Data:

When the Presenter receives the data via didRetrieveRockets(_:), it tells the View to display the data by invoking view?.displayRockets(rockets).
The RocketsViewController (the View) then takes this data, stores it, and reloads the table view to reflect this data.

Error Handling:

If there's an error, the Presenter instructs the View to handle or display the error. For now, you're just printing the error, but you can implement more user-friendly error handling here.

User Interaction:

When a user interacts with the app, such as tapping a rocket, tableView(_:didSelectRowAt:) is invoked.
In the provided code, it's commented out, but if implemented, it would inform the Presenter that a rocket was selected using presenter.didSelectRocket(at:).
The Presenter can then decide how to handle this interaction, such as showing details of the rocket, and possibly involve the Router for any navigation.
